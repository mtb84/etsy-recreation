      description:
        "*****USPS is running behind due to the Holidays.  If you want your item sooner, I have a USPS priority shipping option.*****\n\n***Please Read the item description***\n***You must use a heat press. **No Iron**\n\nLight colored polyester shirts work best as sublimation does not print white, so if you have white on your transfer, it will be the color of your shirt. White or Grey shirts work the best. Absolutely no darker shirts .\n\nSublimation Transfers:\nThe sublimation transfer must be used on a 50% or more polyester garment. 50% polyester will give it a vintage look as some fading will occur after washing, since sublimation ink only adheres to the polyester in the garment. If you want your shirt to stay vibrant and not have any fading whatsoever, please use 100% polyester. 100% polyester will yield the most vibrant results and it will not fade. I only recommend using a transfer 1 time.\n\nSublimation Directions\nPreheat your heat press to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Make sure you adjust your press for medium pressure.\nLint roll your shirt really well and prepress your shirt for 15 seconds to remove any moisture (lint rolling is important especially if using white shirts to prevent tiny blue dots on your shirt after pressing.)\nPut a sheet of butcher paper in the inside of your shirt to prevent the image bleeding through\nPlace your transfer printed side down on the location that you want it on your shirt. You can use heat tape to keep your transfer from moving. It must be heat tape only.\nCover the whole shirt with a sheet of butcher paper and press 400 degrees for 60 seconds\nOnce 60 seconds is done, remove the butcher paper and carefully pull off the sublimation transfer in one direction trying not to let the image touch as you pull it up, to prevent ghosting and extra ink getting on your shirt.\n\n***Recommended Shirts: *Gildan G420 - Sports Gray, White *Cricut Infusible Ink Shirts * Jerzees 21M \u2013 Athletic Heather, Silver, White or any other light colors* https://bubbakinsblanks.com/- has a ton of 100% polyester shirts and are nice and not as see through.\n\n***MUGS - Please use the user manual that your mug press came with. Please only use sublimation coated mugs as regular mugs will not work.\n\n***Washing Instructions - Turn Garment inside out. Machine wash cold. No bleach. No fabric softeners. Do not dry clean. Do not iron. Tumble dry at low heat.\n\nNo returns due to user error\n\nAll transfers are printed on high quality sublimation paper with high quality sublimation ink! Your transfer may appear dull upon arrival, that is because the special inks are heat activated. Once pressed they will be more vibrant.  The colors on the listing may be slightly different from the transfer.",

        "Cow Quilt Pattern in Multiple sizes, 36x42 Baby Quilt, 24x28 and 48x56 great for Throw or bordered Twin, Instant Download PDF, Farm Quilt",
      description:
        "This listing is for the Cow quilt pattern.  The main instruction is for the Crib size 36&quot;x42&quot;, with additional pages for a smaller 24\u201dx28\u201d and larger 48&quot;x56&quot;. The sample quilt shown is done in the 36x42 size which is perfect for a baby&#39;s crib. However, if you pair it with the pig or another farm friend in the crib size and bordered the two together with cute farm fabric you could have an adorable twin. \n\n*Skill Level: Beginner Straight Cutting and Straight Seams\nThis pattern is traditionally pieced, not applique. \n     The pattern lists fabric yardage, then uses charts to show the number of strips to cut and the number of pieces to cut from those strips. The entire top is then sewn using straight 1/4&quot; seams following a full page color image of the quilt top labeled alphabetically. The shaping is done with quick corner half square triangles. \n      I have some instructional videos on youtube and my facebook page. Just search Counted Quilts. \n\n*PDF format\n      You are ordering a 6 page color quilt pattern in PDF format to be downloaded once payment has been received, and then printed by you. \nIf you are interested in a paper copy mailed to you see listing https://www.etsy.com/listing/150204123/childrens-quilt-patterns-paper-copy\n\nThank you for shopping at Counted Quilts",

      description:
        "Hand-stamped western inspired metal ring for all my barrel racing cowgirls \u26a1\ufe0f \n\n1/2\u201d Width\n\nThese are hand-stamped and packaged by me. Due to each ring being hand-stamped, the spacing and color may vary slightly from pictures. They\u2019re adjustable and super lightweight! It is not recommended to continue bending the metal once you get it to fit your size as continuously bending metal will break it. The aluminum will not rust or turn your skin green. I use a heavy-duty permanent black ink to make the design stand out, but any water or chemicals can cause that to fade away after time, so avoid getting water or perfume on your new jewelry. If you have any questions please feel free to message me, I\u2019d be more than happy to answer any questions!\n\n\u2729 Ring Fading? Here\u2019s a quick & easy fix! \u2729\n-use a sharpie to color in the lettering and allow it to dry for at least 5 minutes\n-wipe off the excess with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel",

      description:
        "*Prices are for ONE skull*\nThis listing is for a few different damaged animal skulls (please select which one you want from the drop down tab, pictures are labelled) These would be a nice addition to a skull or curio collection. \nThere is a young cow skull cap, a damaged sheep skull and some partial deer skull parts. All the skulls are damaged or not complete.\n\n1. Calf skull cap measures 19x16cm\n2. Damaged small sheep skull. It had some dried dirt stuck at the back of the nasal cavity, I shook as much out as I could but a little bit could still fall out on its way to you. 15x12cm\n3. Partial deer skull (one half of upper jaw area), I think from a young fallow deer. 20cm long\n4. Damaged small deer lower jaw (I think a roe deer) It has gnaw marks on it from a rodent chewing on it! 12cm long\n\nPlease see the photos for condition. They are clean enough to be displayed or used straight away but you may want to do further cleaning. Also see the photos of each skull in my hand to get an idea of their sizes.\n\nCannot be sent to Germany, Australia or New Zealand, sorry!\n\n****************************************************************\n\nPlease select the shipping upgrade with tracking if you want your parcel to be protected from getting lost in the post etc, unfortunately I can no longer give refunds for &#39;lost&#39; packages if the tracking upgrade wasn&#39;t purchased, unless I can make a successful claim with the postal service. I have still left an option to buy standard shipping as I&#39;m aware the tracked postage can be pricey (especially for overseas customers) but please be aware this is at your own risk. However, I will always do my very best to make sure your item(s) arrive to you safely and on time, whatever postage has been selected, but it is out of my control once it enters the postal system. If the item is damaged, a refund can be arranged if a photo is sent.\n\nIf you buy more than one item, the combined standard shipping price should adjust to cover tracked shipping if the value of the order is over \u00a320. However the system isn&#39;t perfect so if you are charged more than the actual shipping cost then I will refund you any extra.\n\nThank you",

        "---- LISTING ----\n\nTurning Two Girl Farm Birthday Invitation digital file.\n\n* Sizing options 4x6 or 5x7. \n* If another size is needed just let me know\n\nYou may print as many invitations as you need for your party\n\n\n&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n---- WHEN ORDERING ----\n\nAt checkout (in the notes to seller section), please let me know how you would like your invitation personalized. Please be sure to include the following:\n\n- Guest of Honor&#39;s Name\n- Day, Date & Time of event\n- Venue Name and/or Address\n- RSVP information (if wanted)\n\n{{ Include capitalization and spelling as you want it to appear on your invitation. }}\n\n&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n---- MATCHING MILESTONE BOARD ----\n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/645346868/cow-farm-birthday-milestone-board-cow\n\n&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n---- HOW LONG DOES THIS ALL TAKE? ----\n\n\nOnce order is completed and I have received your personalized information you will receive your proof within 24 to 48 hours via email (excluding weekends and holidays). At that time, you will have 24 hours to request any changes you may see needed. Typically orders are completed within 48 hours, but do tend vary depending on how long it takes the buyer to approve the proof. \n\nPlease note: If you fail to provide your party information and I have to request it the order process may be delayed. \n\nNEED IT SOONER? \n\nIn a rush? Check out my Rush Order Fee that can be added to any order. \n\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/196327927/rush-order-invitation-add-on?ref=shop_home_active_19\n\n&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n---- PRINTING ----\n\nThe invitation is sized to be printed as a normal picture, so you can print it anywhere you print pictures. Keep in mind it is cheaper to print a 4x6 than a 5x7 if you are working with a budget. \n\nYou may also print these yourself at home. \n\nWHERE DO I PRINT? When creating invitations for personal use I print at CVS or Walgreens. Again you can print anywhere you print pictures. \n\n&lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n---- FINE PRINT ----\n\n****If printing through a retailer be sure you are sending/uploading the image in high quality. Failure to do  so will result in poor printed image quality. This is a buyer responsibility. \n\n****Please, be sure to double check the personalized information you are sending me. I can only put in\nwhat you send me. Once proof is approved I am not responsible for any incorrect details that may have \nbeen overlooked. If other edits are needed please contact me. I will do my best to work with you. \n\n****THIS IS FOR A DIGITAL FILE ONLY, nothing will be physically mailed to you, the buyer.\n\n****TERMS OF USE\nInvitation was created and designed by Buzy Bee Design Company and customized for you upon purchase. You are paying for a creative service and the time and labor used to create your custom invitation. Your purchase is permitted for a ONE TIME PERSONAL USE.

        "Put the finishing touch on your farm or ranch with this custom made to order cattle/horse brand metal cutout. \n\nDesigned and cut to your specifications. Just send me your brand or logo and I&#39;ll create your sign. \nIf you don&#39;t have a brand just let me know how you want it designed. You can sketch out your design idea and send me a picture so I have an idea of how you want it.  \n\nWe will not cut the sign until you are satisfied with the design so be sure you are checking your Etsy Messages periodically. The sooner I can get an approval, the sooner it gets cut and shipped. \n\nThese are sold bare metal and ready for your paint, powder coat, or clear coat.\n\nPlease take precaution when handling the sign as some edges can be sharp. \n\nIf you have a brand you can take a picture and send it to me so I can recreate it using my editing software. \nIf you don&#39;t have a brand but an idea of how you want it, just draw a rough sketch of the desired design, take a picture and send it to me. \n\nOnce I get the image or Idea of your brand, it generally only takes me a couple days to get you a proof for approval. \n\nSizes: 19 inch, 23.5 inches, or 30 inches. The widths will vary based on design. If the width is larger than the height I will use it as the stated nominal size. For instance, if you order a 19 inch sign and the width of your design is larger that the height, I will keep the proportion and make it 19 inches wide. The height will be smaller than 19 inches depending on how the proportions work out. \n\n\nCustom sized brands are also offered so feel free to message me if you have any questions.  \n\nCustom Cattle Brand personalized for your Farm, Ranch, Camp, or Hunting Lodge. Sold as bare metal ready for paint.",

Custom orders are an option so feel free to message us!\n\n- Message us for wholesale options & pricing.\n\n- Our freshies last 30 - 45 days. Some scents are naturally stronger than others and will last longer. Freshies may lose their scent faster in warmer months due to the sun drawing the scent out faster.\n\n- Keep away from children and pets.\n\n- Do not ingest.\n\nDISCLAIMER: When set on flat, hot surfaces, freshie oils may stain. Freshies could melt in extreme temperatures, so please be aware of this is the dead of summer. The Scented Cactus is not responsible for replacing freshies if they melt or any damages they may cause.

      description:
        "This is a unisex tee, Bella + Canvas brand in the colorway of White .\n\nSizes are currently available from Small to 4XL.  Availability subject to change.\n\nThese tees are made using sublimation ink to form a more permanent bond than vinyl and some screen print transfer materials.\n\nThese are made to order and have a processing time of 1-2 weeks simply because I cannot control shipping from my shirt supplier to me. Chances are it will arrive much sooner and will be in your hands much sooner.  They average 3-5 days shipping time after I order, but there have been a few incidents where it took longer - especially in snow. \n\nBleach also takes an additional day. Bleaching is available on other colors. Some other color options may be available.  Just shoot me a PM before ordering so we can verify first.",

You will receive a 12-page PDF file that will be immediately available to download after your payment processes. The pattern is in English only and uses U.S. crochet terminology. \n\nThis is a customizable pattern in which you&#39;ll be able to choose accent colors of your choice if you desire a cow with a specific theme. I urge you to have fun with all of the different possible color combinations! It does not include how to crochet additional accessories (ex: strawberry, blueberry, sunflower, etc), but is just for the cow itself. \n\nThis pattern assumes that you understand the basics of amigurumi such as: \n- creating a magic ring \n- increasing & decreasing \n- making simple color changes \n- sewing/attaching pieces together \n\nMaterials Used: \n- Bernat Blanket Yarn (white color, tan color, and accent color of choice -- I used chocolate brown in the pattern) \n- 8mm crochet hook \n- Darning needle \n- Stuffing \n- 20 mm safety eyes \n\nFinished product will be around 10 inches tall. \n\nAgain, please note that this is a pattern only.

      description:
        "Handcrafted and handpainted right here in India, you can be assured that you will receive an authentic piece of Indian home decor bound to get people talking when they visit your home!\n\nProcess: All of our items are made by artisans in Kerala, South India. We work with a range of craftsmen who have decades of experience in this craft. Each piece has been carved out from a single block of wood. The ears are detachable and there is a hole carved out in the back of the Nandi for you to hang it proudly on your wall. \n\nCondition: Please not that none of these images have been edited. They have been taken in a natural light, to show the authenticity of each piece. So please view detailed photos for overall quality, minor scuffs, scratches, marks etc. Please note that no two are identical as they are handmade, no Nandi made is ever the same! \n\nHistory: Inspired by the Oachira Cattle Festival, based in Kerala, South India. In this festival, large bull shaped structures are created. These Ceremonial sculptures are used on the front of hundreds of chariots and are then paraded around the temple. In Hindu tradition, Nandi (bull) is the vehicle for the Hindu god of Shiva, destroyer and creator of worlds. Today, the bull is considered a symbol of Hinduism. Nandi symbolises purity, as well as justice, faith, wisdom, virility and honour.",

      description:
        "Are you looking for the perfect Highland Cow gift? These ceramic wax melters/oil burners are handmade by a small company in Yorkshire and are hand decorated with a colourful decoupage image of colourful McCoo in a similar style to the steven brown paintings.   If you like that art style, this would be the perfect addition to your home decor.  \n\nThese ceramic melters just do not compare to the mass produced imports from China and I love the fact that two small, UK businesses have got together to bring these quality products to your home. \n\nEach melter is 13.5 cm high and this height includes the ceramic plate and sturdy glass dish. \n\nI have a number of different highland cow designs and you can view them by clicking this link\nhttps://etsy.me/3GnH8VC\n\nIf you would like to view my full range of candles, please view via this link.\nhttps://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/RoseRoomGiftsUK \n\nTo enjoy using your product safely, please follow these usage instructions  \n\n\ud83d\udd36Use either a wax melt OR Water with a few drops of fragrance oil. \n\ud83d\udd36NEVER mix water and wax.  \n\ud83d\udd36Check that the glass melting dish is undamaged \n\ud83d\udd36Place wax into the melting dish taking care not to over fill.  \n\ud83d\udd36Place an unscented, 4 hour, metal cup tea light on the base plate of the melter \n\ud83d\udd36Light the tealight and place the melter body centrally on the base plate \n\ud83d\udd36After use, allow the melter to cool and the wax to harden",
